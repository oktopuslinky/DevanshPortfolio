Team project built with Google Maps, Places, and Photos APIs to help users discover nearby restaurants, attractions, and custom search results. 

The map and locations are displayed using the Google Maps API.
The Google Places API is used to fetch nearby locations and their information.
The Google Photos API is used to fetch a photo of the location.

Users can view location photos, explore map markers, and launch Google Maps navigation directly from the app.
